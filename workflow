The code for calculating the (penalized) RDE estimator on a specific data set is written in the R package *RdeGlmLassoGam*, that is available at https://github.com/RdeGlmLassoGam/RdeGlmLassoGam. The main function is called *RDE*, of which the details with respect to the parameters, output and small examples can be found in the help files of the package.

At https://github.com/RdeGlmLassoGam/RDE_data_examples/tree/main/Data_Analyse, the R script files of each real data example can be found.  This includes the numerical results and the figures discussed in the paper.
